# Aggregating microglia single cell coexpression

This project takes data from the TRsc project (https://github.com/PavlidisLab/TR_singlecell) 
to perform cell type-specific aggregate coexpression. I explore differing forms
of coexpression aggregation, and compare aggregates between mouse and human.
he focus is on microglia, but aggregates are also built for macrophages for the
pupose of demoing differential coexpression.

This project is intrinsically dependant on paths from the TRsc project that
live on the Pavlab servers and are not easy to share.
