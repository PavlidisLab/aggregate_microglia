# Aggregating microglia single cell coexpression

This project takes data from the TRsc project (https://github.com/PavlidisLab/TR_singlecell) 
to perform cell type-specific aggregate coexpression. I explore differing forms
of coexpression aggregation, and compare aggregates between mouse and human.
The focus is on microglia, but aggregates are also built for macrophages for the
purpose of demoing differential coexpression.

This project is intrinsically dependant on data paths from the TRsc project that
live on the Pavlab servers, which are not easy to share.
